# NFL Dashboard
This project uses National Football League data to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key NFL team statistics across multiple seasons. Even though there are many categories under season statistics, this project emphasizes offensive and defensive performances during the 17game regular season. The National Football League, or sports in general, are increasingly becoming data-centered, with individual and team performances at the forefront. Teams and analysts use these statistics for game plans, player analysis, and predictions. This dashboard will provide users with an organized and simplified interface to visually represent these performances.  
 
The visualizations in this dashboard allow for quick and easy comparisons between teams across each of the last five seasons, saving fans, like me, from having to scroll through dense and disorganized spreadsheets. Additionally, for those who play Fantasy Football each season, this interactive dashboard will highlight teams that perform well offensively, which will help guide you through your fantasy draft and in-season trades. Further, through these visualizations, users can uncover team trends and patterns due to the projectâ€™s five-year data range. Lastly, this project prioritizes reproducibility, so this dashboard will be updated at the end of each season, always displaying the previous five-year interval.
